## Article Review
* **Title:** Back to the future: origins and directions of the "Agile Manifesto" â€“ views of the originators
* **Link:** https://jserd.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40411-018-0059-z

### My Thoughts
I found this article highly related to the course content that we have covered in the past two weeks. It reflects on the origin of the "Agile Manifesto" while projecting its current state onto its future. The authors conducted surveys and further conversations with software engineers who are familiar with or applying the agile framework. In the end, the authors encouraged current and future agile software engineers to reflect on their own framework and workflow based on a callback to the origin of "Agile Manifesto".

### Key Takeaways
- The Agile Manifesto's principles remain relevant but need adaptation to modern software development
- Continuous reflection on development practices is essential for growth
- The original authors' perspectives provide valuable insights for current practitioners
